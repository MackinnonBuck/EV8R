# EV8R
Ever wanted to send a file via email that exceeded the size limit permitted by the provider?  Now you can!  EV8R evades the size limit by splitting the desired files into smaller files that fit within the size limit.  On the receiving end, EV8R can then load the smaller files and combine them back into the original.
